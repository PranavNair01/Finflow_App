Finflow is a smart pond monitoring system where we use sensors and automate volumetric titrations to check the levels of water quality parameters, which were previously done manually. The values of these parameters get stored and computed in the cloud and sent to the mobile app where the farmer is warned whenever a parameter is at a dangerous level.
